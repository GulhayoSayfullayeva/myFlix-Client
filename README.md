Objective
Using React, build the client-side for an app called myFlix based on its
existing server-side code (REST API and database).
Context
Client-side development hasn’t always been so prominent. In the past, pages would be generated on
the server-side and sent to the browser, resulting in a poor user experience. Thanks to modern
browsers and libraries such as React, the client-side of an app is today considered to be just as
important as the server-side. Full-stack developers need to be well-versed in both server-side and
client-side development.
In the previous Achievement, you built the server-side for a movie app called myFlix. The API and
database that you built meet the information needs of myFlix users. Now, you need to create the
interface they’ll use when making requests to—and receiving responses from—the server-side. The
client-side of your myFlix app will include several interface views (built using the React library) that will
handle data through the (previously defined) REST API endpoints.
The code you write impacts both your users and your fellow developers. As you work through this
Achievement, you’ll need to consider, among other things, the readability and maintenance of your
codebase, and the design and usability of your app.
By the end of the Achievement, you’ll have a complete web app (client-side and server-side) built using
full-stack JavaScript technologies, which you can then showcase in your portfolio. This project will
demonstrate your mastery of full-stack JavaScript development. The complete tech stack you’ll
master is known as the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) stack.
